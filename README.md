# Persona 5: Text-Based

This repo contains a cleaned-up version of my machine project submitted as part
of an introductory programming course. It is a social simulation video game
set in the universe of Persona 5, where players take on the role of Ren Amamiya
as he recounts the 60 days before he was accused of a crime he did not commit.
Over the course of the game, Ren would need to build up social skills, rekindle
old friendships, and gain their support.

Though the root directory contains the cleaned-up source files, the
`Machine Project5` folder contains the actual files I submitted at the time of
the requirement. If you're interested in what the code was like back from when
I was in Term 1, that's where you should look at! I was still quite new to C at
the time, so there are certain weird quirks to be found there. Hopefully this
newer version is cleaner, but it still definitely isn't truly guiltless.

Have fun!
